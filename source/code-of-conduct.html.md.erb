This code isn’t an exhaustive or limited list of things you can’t do. Rather, the intention is to be a guide that can help make it easier enrich our community.
All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors and affiliates are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. Details for contacting us online are on our website, http://localhost.events.

The organisers will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any of our events. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at all hosted events.

Lastly, don’t forget to listen to and respect one another. Treat each other with kindness and remember that there will always be disagreements, but that’s okay - we’re unique and everyone is entitled to an opinion. It would be a boring world if we were all the same. Our difference in opinions are what will help us challenge each other and help in our growth. Everyone’s there to learn something, so be kind, patient and respectful.

Be sure to welcome newcomers so that they don’t feel like an outsider. Last of all, have fun!
