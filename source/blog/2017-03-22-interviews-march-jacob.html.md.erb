##Jacob Impson

Fullstack web dev @ Juicebox

###Describe yourself in 4 words?

“Quirky, enthusiastic, welcoming and stubborn”

###What about Localhost has excited you the most?

“The fact that is exists,” Jacob laughed, “I’m excited because its an accessible way to branch out of... it’s an easy way to stop yourself from getting trapped inside a day job related tunnel vision.”

###What’s the coolest thing in tech that's come out in the last year?

“I’m excited about way too many things – I’m excited about VR, it’s the first real paradigm shift we’ve had in the last 15 years”

###And here it is, I asked Jacob what’s something no one knows about you?

"I play in a pop punk band called Being Beta."

After hearing this I did some side research and they’ve got a pretty great sound, like down to earth aussie All Time Low, their sound inspires good times; check them out here; http://www.beingbeta.com.au

Chuck them a like on Facebook and ask Jacob when Being Beta is playing next, next Locahost!
