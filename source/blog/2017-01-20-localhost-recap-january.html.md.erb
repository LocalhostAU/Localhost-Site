The most recent meetup represented the end of an era, a farewell to Port80 and the beginning of a brand new direction.

This night was about the celebration of our community. It was a reflection on what has brought together this unique industry culture over the last 15 years to where it is today and an exploration of the possibilities that lay ahead for the future.

Patima, Port80’s current renowned host and organiser, expressed the importance of contemplation, endeavoring to always be better and aiming to achieve more. She expressed her love for the event’s strong past and shaping of the web industry today.

Patima bid Port80 farewell and acknowledged Miles Burke and Bret Treasure for their past years of dedication to the web community. She thanked AWIA (Australia Web Industry Association) for their continued support of Port80 and now Localhost.

She discussed a time of change but a one of opportunity and growth. She unveiled the Localhost concept to an excited crowd; a Multi-city-supercharged-touring-meetup-roadshow.

Localhost began through consideration of what it takes to be world class, as Patima discussed, she explored what potential can a generalist meetup like this achieve? What does the Australian industry actually need? What can help amplify individual and community growth and how can we encourage more diversity?

Localhost will connect web, creative and digital communities and unearth local talent across Australia.

The initiative aspires to create more opportunities for Australian designers and developers, turning up the volume on the Australian industry's voice and bridging the distance to enable more knowledge sharing and collaboration.

Local events in Perth, Sydney and Melbourne, similar in style to the beloved Port80 event will host speakers from the community in an environment that fosters connection and collaboration. Each presentation will be shared online for those in other cities to watch every month.

...EXCEPT... when there’s a deployment (mic drop). Localhost:deployments will see a supercharged meetup touring in multiple destinations across the country. Localhost will provide local speakers opportunities and exposure beyond their local communities, strengthening the industry by removing barriers to sharing knowledge. It will provide local communities with access to more knowledge and diversity and improve the quality of the Australian web industry through interstate collaboration.

> Three speakers, across three locations, in three days; the first deployment is booked to commence on Wednesday, June 1st.

Localhost represents a further step forward for the Australian Web Industry, from Port80 beginnings in 2002, a small meetup of like minded people that would continue to outgrow itself time and time again as more Australians fell in love with the web. It’s an event that has been loved by many, leading to employment, friendships and collaboration. While it’s sad to leave Port80 behind, the future of Localhost already looks bright.

On Thursday the 18th of January, Patima Tantiprasut, supported by Corey Ginnivan, David Thomas and Teegan Lincoln, in association with AWIA proudly introduced our community to Localhost, a multi-city-supercharged-touring-meetup-roadshow that promises to be a good one.

See you Wednesday the 1st of Feburary!


Love,
Localhost
