The first official Localhost Perth meetup played host to an inter-state speaker, Georgie Luhur, a Front-end developer at Campaign Monitor in Sydney. Georgie’s presentation was an inspiring and in-depth look into "Creative ways to style figures and figcaptions" – a perhaps often underappreciated element in content styling and design.

Georgie’s talk focused on the potential fig and figcaption styling can have on a piece of content. As something all web developers are familiar with, these small elements of HTML5 can make a big impact.

Figures and figcaptions are self-contained content, though not necessarily independent; they are references from the content, though not a part of and are thus, quite a unique feature.

Beyond blogs, news websites and publications, Georgie notes that their styling is able to be utilised as part of a blockquote or poem as well as complimenting advertisements, audio and video clips. With so many opportunities for experimentation, how do we push for something new, something further away from the ordinary?

Providing us with over 42 well considered and creative ways to style fig and figcaptions there became a recognition that the possibilities were endless and as Georgie impressed, “You are only limited by your imagination”.

When not kicking butt as a Front-end developer at Campaign Monitor, Georgie loves travelling, taking photos and blogging on her self-described ‘nicheless’ site [Hey Georgie](http://hey.georgie.nu). Georgie is passionate about the information technology industry and finding ways to increase inclusivity and diversity in our community – particularly encouraging women to stand up and engage within our collective.

The first Localhost meetup really set things into motion, in less than a month since the launch, the Localhost crowd was very appreciative to already be hearing from an interstate speaker. Insights into different understandings and knowledge within our industry, from people of diverse backgrounds and experiences is what makes our community grow. To be lucky enough to have those opportunities illustrates the passion and pride we all share.

Georgie, it was a pleasure!

Love,
Localhost
