The night starts off with some casual intros and chats over drinks and tasty food in a place we haven’t tried yet (and a lot of it!). After dish after dish came out, our bellies were very happy and ready for hearty conversations.

If you haven’t heard about [Discussion Dinners](https://twitter.com/discussiondins) before, I can, with plenty of bias, say that it’s a really rad event. It’s a night capped to ten people discussing hot topics over a nice meal together. Each one has had a different mix of people each time and it’s the variety and diversity that we see in everyone’s backgrounds that’s the absolute coolest; designers, developers, strategists, marketers, students and managers - all are welcome!

It’s a little different to the typical meetup where there could be 50-60 people mingling and we wanted to create something that would interest those who prefer a more intimate setting. The literal table limit makes it a small event and encourages participation in interesting, high quality conversations.

We do this with the help of some custom-made topic cards affectionately known as the [MEOW cards](https://dribbble.com/shots/2985608-MEOW-Cards) (**m**eet **e**veryone **o**ver **w**ine/**w**hiskey/**w**ater cards), designed by yours truly, just for a bit of fun.

##The format.

We take turns flipping over the MEOW cards and discuss our perspectives on each, until everyone’s had a turn at doing so.

There’s no time limit to discussions about topics - we keep that organic so everyone can have a chance to contribute.

We listen and learn from each other in a safe, supportive and respectful environment.

##The topics.

Here are some of the spicy topics we had fun chatting about:

  * Hamburger menus
  * Open plan offices
  * What to learn next
  * Remote teams
  * Weirdest client or manager request
  * When I grow up… (career advancement options?)
  * Salaries in Perth

Phew! Would you like that served mild, medium or hot?
