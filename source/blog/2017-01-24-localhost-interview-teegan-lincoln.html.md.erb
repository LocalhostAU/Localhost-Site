leadParagraph: Hey Teegan, front-end developer @ Bam Creative! Let's chat about Localhost.
---

####1. Why are you excited for localhost?

I'm excited to be apart of the Localhost Perth team because it's something that's giving people within the Perth web community an opportunity to travel, be exposed to new audiences, and be recognised for their awesomeness nationwide.

In the past, young designers and developers have been drawn to Melbourne and Sydney for career opportunities, but by showcasing the talented web folk in our own backyard I hope we can prove that Perth isn't to be underestimated.

####2. Describe yourself in 4 words

Pink-haired Internet Enthusiast.

####3. What's the hardest thing about being a front end developer?

I could complain about the obvious things like IE8, or email newsletter templates, but honestly those kind of challenges are what makes the job fun!

However, when your client is insistent on using a certain platform/technology/thing you’ve never used before and its documentation sucks? Yeah, that’s hard. #stackexchange4days

####4. What new tech are you pumped about?

After Mark Pesce's talk, WebVR: Building and browsing cyberspace at Direction 2016, I’ve been quite interesting in delving more into virtual reality for the web browser.

With tools such as A-Frame, and three.js, the technology is already available and the possibilities are endless.


Woo! Thanks for the chat Teegan. I'm sure that people have more questions that they'd love to ask you.
