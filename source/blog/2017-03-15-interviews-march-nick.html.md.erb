##Nick Barrett

Lead developer at Juicebox

###The more I ask this question the more it seems to turn into an impromptu job interview, nonetheless I asked Nick to describe himself in 4 words?
“modest, understanding, innovative, problem-solver”

###What’s something no one knows about you?
“I used to be a really good swimmer”

###What about Localhost has got you the most excited?
“The fact that it’s now a national thing and we’re going to have speakers from over east and send people over there as well; it’s not just a Perth thing but a national event.”

###Where would you like to see this community going?
“I feel like it’s already going there, it’s not just for people in the web anymore, but everyone in the digital space.”

Being a designer/marketer myself I couldn’t agree more. Remember to hang out with Nick next Localhost!
