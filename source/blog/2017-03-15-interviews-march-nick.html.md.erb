Nick Barrett - Lead developer at Juicebox

##The more I ask this question the more it seems to turn into an impromptu job interview, nonetheless I asked Nick to describe himself in 4 words?
Modest.

Understanding.

Innovative

Problem-solver.

##What’s something not many people know about you?
I used to be a really good swimmer.

##What about Localhost has got you the most excited?
The fact that it’s now a national thing and we’re going to have speakers from over east and send people over there as well; it’s not just a Perth thing but a national event.

##Where would you like to see this community going?
I feel like it’s already going there, it’s not just for people in the web anymore, but everyone in the digital space.

Being a designer/marketer myself I couldn’t agree more.

Nick, thanks for chatting to us and really appreciate your insights. People, make sure you have a chat to this champ at the next event!


Cheers,
The team at Localhost
