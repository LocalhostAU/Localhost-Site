Localhost is a meetup designed to connect web, creative and digital communities, unearthing local talent across Australia. Prior to it’s inception, Localhost was formerly known as Port80, a community meetup that ran monthly in Perth for 15 years.

This new initiative aims to strengthen the Australian industry through a number of ways and steered by the following questions:

Localhost has a unique concept behind it; we definitely didn’t want it to be just another meetup clogging up the calendar in our already busy lives! While the local meetups will continue to run on a regular basis, it’s Localhost:Deployment which offers something truly different.

> “A multi-city, supercharged, touring, meetup roadshow.”

Talks will be recorded and published soon after the event/s to enable reflection and continued public consumption, along with further amplifying the visibility and opportunities for the speakers.

The slides from the launch event held in Perth, 19th January 2017 are available for viewing and comments via slides.com.

\* Stage one will include Perth, Sydney and Melbourne as the deployment locations, with the goal to expand out to more … “branches” in future.
