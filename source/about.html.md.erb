<div class="column-content">
  <p>Localhost is a meetup designed to connect web, creative and digital communities, unearthing local talent across Australia. Prior to it’s inception, Localhost was formerly known as Port80, a community meetup that ran monthly in Perth for 15 years.</p>

  <p>This new initiative aims to strengthen the Australian industry through a number of ways and steered by the following questions:</p>

  <ol class="questions">
      <li>What potential can a generalist meetup like this achieve?</li>
      <li>What does the Australian industry actually need?</li>
      <li>What can help amplify individual and community growth?</li>
      <li>How can we encourage more diversity?</li>
      <li>What does it take to be world-class?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Localhost has a unique concept behind it; we definitely didn’t want it to be just another meetup clogging up the calendar in our already busy lives! While the local meetups will continue to run on a regular basis, it’s Localhost:Deployment which offers something truly different.</p>

  <p>Described by Patima as a multi-city, supercharged, touring, meetup roadshow, the deployment will see a speaker representing each city form a touring line-up that will travel together to each location, sharing their knowledge to new audiences, challenging individual comfort zones and gaining XP along the way.</p>

  <p class="tagline">3 speakers. 3 locations. 3 days.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Talks will be recorded and published soon after the event/s to enable reflection and continued public consumption, along with further amplifying the visibility and opportunities for the speakers.</p>

  <p>The slides from the launch event held in Perth, 19th January 2017 are available for viewing and comments via <a href="https://slides.com" title="View Talk Slides at Slides.com">slides.com</a>.</p>

  <p>* Stage one will include Perth, Sydney and Melbourne as the deployment locations, with the goal to expand out to more... "branches" in future.</p>
