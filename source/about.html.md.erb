Localhost is a meetup designed to connect web, creative and digital communities, unearthing local talent across Australia. Localhost was born out of Port80 Perth, a community meetup that ran monthly in Perth for 15 years, and is powered by our passionate team of volunteers.

Launched in 2017, this initiative aims to strengthen the Australian industry through a number of ways and is steered by the desire to solve the following questions:

1. What potential can a generalist meetup like this achieve?
1. What does the Australian industry actually need?
1. What can help amplify individual and community growth?
1. How can we encourage more diversity?
1. What does it take to be world-class?

##THE CONCEPT

Localhost has a unique concept behind it; we definitely didn’t want it to be just another meetup clogging up the calendar in our already busy lives! While the local Perth meetups will continue to run on a regular basis, it’s Localhost:Deployment which offers something truly different.

Described by our founder, Patima, as a "multi-city, supercharged, touring, meetup roadshow", the deployment will see a speaker representing each city form a touring line-up that will travel together to each location, sharing their knowledge to new audiences, challenging individual comfort zones and gaining XP along the way.

Our first roadshow ("deployment") will be held in June.

4 speakers. 4 locations. 4 days.

##LOCAL BRANCHES

Monthly meetup events with an awesome speaker are currently run on the first Wednesday of every month in Perth. The Perth branch also organise a series of other regular community events.

Exciting update! Brisbane will be also launching a branch in May 2017.

Talks will be filmed and published soon after the event/s to enable reflection and continued public consumption, along with further amplifying the visibility and opportunities for the speakers.

The slides are also available for viewing and comments.

##CHASING OUR UNICORN

We have a lot of work ahead of us with the monthly events and roadshow, but there are also some other great projects in the works. Every project that we’re undertaking will be guided by our goals. We’re on a mission!
